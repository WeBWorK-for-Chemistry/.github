Everything here is intended to allow you to write WeBWorK problems with a more chemistry-focused approach.  Signficant figures, chemical names and formulas as units/labels, parsing inorganic binary formulas and names, etc.

Also included is an open-source library of problems for intro chemistry and beyond.
